NS2-DASH
========

This is a summary of the project of ``HTTP adaptive streaming simulation framework'',
in which we developed a DASH simulator base on the NS-2 simulator.

The needed files:

[ns2docsis-release-1.0-alpha.tar.gz](http://netlab.cs.clemson.edu/ns2docsis-release-1.0-alpha.tar.gz)

If the file is not found, you may use the mirror [mirror-ns2docsis](http://github.com/yhfudev/mirror-ns2docsis.git)

The files contains the patched NS-2 2.33, which supports both DASH and DOCSIS simulation.

If you familar with NS-2, you may take a look the file ns2docsis-release-1.0-alpha/ns-2.33/vodapp/README,
and also the test script ns2docsis-release-1.0-alpha/ns-2.33/vodapp/testvod.tcl.

To run the simulator in a computer cluster, you may interest in the project [mrnative](https://github.com/yhfudev/bash-mrnative.git).
